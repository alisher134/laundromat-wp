## 💡 Icon Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use simple, clear icons (not complex illustrations)
- Keep icons consistent in style across all cards
- Use brand colors or neutral colors
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Use transparent backgrounds

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use photos or complex images
- Mix different icon styles (outlined + filled)
- Use text in icons (use the title/description instead)
- Use very detailed icons (they'll be small)
- Forget to test how they look on the page

## 🔍 Example Icons Set

Here are three icons that work well together for a laundromat:

### Set 1: Minimal Outlined Style
- **Clock icon** (24/7 service)
- **Timer icon** (fast service)
- **Tag icon** (low prices)

Search "clock outline icon", "timer outline icon", "tag outline icon"

### Set 2: Filled Circular Style
- **Clock in circle** (always open)
- **Lightning in circle** (fast)
- **Dollar in circle** (affordable)

Search "clock circle filled", "lightning circle filled", "dollar circle filled"

### Set 3: Modern Gradient Style
- **24/7 badge** (availability)
- **Speedometer** (speed)
- **Discount badge** (pricing)

Search "24-7 badge icon", "speedometer icon", "discount badge icon"

## 📏 Testing Your Icons

Before finalizing, check:

1. **Size**: Do they look clear at small size?
2. **Color**: Do they contrast well with background?
3. **Style**: Do all three icons match stylistically?
4. **Spacing**: Do they have enough padding/breathing room?
5. **Mobile**: Check how they look on phone screens

### Quick Preview
Save your icons in the same folder and view them side by side. They should:
- Look like they belong to the same family
- Be equally detailed (or simplified)
- Use similar line weights
- Have similar color intensity

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Icon not showing?**
- Make sure you clicked "Set featured image" (not just uploaded)
- Verify image uploaded successfully to Media Library
- Check that image URL works when clicked in Media Library

**Icon too small/large?**
- Minimum recommended: 100x100px
- Maximum recommended: 500x500px
- The CSS will automatically resize it properly

**Icon has white background?**
- PNG file doesn't have transparency
- Re-export with transparent background
- Or use image editor to remove background

**Icon wrong color?**
- Use one of the color-change methods above
- Or download a different version of the icon

**Icons don't match style?**
- Download all icons from the same icon set
- Use the same icon "family" (e.g., all Heroicons, all Material Icons)
